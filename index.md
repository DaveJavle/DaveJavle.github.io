# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Dave Javle and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

*   Lab 2
    
    Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite as I was granted with a more thorough understanding on how standards are used and worked with. As a result, I am more knowledgeable about very simple programming topics and programming tools. In addition, this part aided in providing me with even more of an interest in computer science as it was very self-explanatory and I felt as if I was more suited to programming now as a result of this.


*   Lab 3
    
    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to gain a grasp on how ints and doubles operate. Because of this lab, I am more knowledgeable of how these data types operate. Therefore, I am more able to work with these data types with a thorough understanding on what and why I am doing something.

*   Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I was provided with a quite simple and explanatory introduction to unit functions. Through this, I received a thorough understanding on how unit functions operate. Now, I am more capable of using and operating with unit functions due to my participation and work on this part of lab 4.
